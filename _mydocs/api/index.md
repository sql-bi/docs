The SQLBI API is organized around [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer). Our API is designed to be easy to use and to support the most common use cases. We have tried to make the API as predictable as possible, so you can easily predict the URLs and the structure of the JSON responses.

> The SQLBI API are in **beta** and we are working to improve them. If you have any feedback, please [let us know](mailto:info@sqlbi.com?subject=SQLBI%20API).
