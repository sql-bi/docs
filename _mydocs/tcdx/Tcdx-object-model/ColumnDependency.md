# **ColumnDependency**

## **Overview**
The **`ColumnDependency`** class in the **TCDX object model** represents a **column-level dependency** between a **Consumer (such as an Excel workbook or Power BI report)** and a **tabular model**. It is used to track which **columns** within a model are referenced by a given Consumer or Item.

## **Purpose**
The primary functions of the `ColumnDependency` class include:
- **Tracking column dependencies** within a tabular model.
- **Providing metadata** about the columns accessed by a Consumer or Item.
- **Facilitating auditing, performance tuning, and data governance** by analyzing column usage patterns.
- **Helping in optimization efforts** by identifying unused or frequently used columns in reporting tools.

This class is essential for **query analysis, dependency tracking, and governance** within Power BI, Excel, and other analytics environments.

## **Public Properties**
The `ColumnDependency` class consists of the following key properties:

| **Property**    | **Type**                | **Description**  |
|----------------|------------------------|------------------|
| `Model`       | `ModelDependency`       | A reference to the **tabular model** where the column resides. |
| `TableName`   | `TcdxName`              | The name of the **table** containing the referenced column. |
| `ColumnName`  | `TcdxName`              | The name of the **referenced column** within the table. |
| `Table`       | `TableDependency`       | A reference to the **table dependency** associated with this column. |
| `ModelColumn` | `Dax.Metadata.Column`   | A reference to the column in the **VertiPaq Analyzer (VPAX) object model**, if available. |

### **Property Details**
- **Model**  
  - This property links the `ColumnDependency` to a **specific tabular model** via a `ModelDependency` object.
  - It helps track which model the column belongs to.

- **TableName**  
  - Stores the **name of the table** that contains the referenced column.
  - This ensures clarity when analyzing column usage within a tabular model.

- **ColumnName**  
  - Identifies the **specific column** being referenced.
  - Helps in determining which fields are directly used in a pivot table, Power BI visual, or any other Consumer component.

- **Table**  
  - Provides a reference to the **TableDependency** associated with this column.
  - This allows for tracking how **tables and columns** are used together.

- **ModelColumn**  
  - If available, this property provides a reference to the **DAX Metadata representation** of the column.
  - Enables deeper analysis of column structure, relationships, and performance implications.

## **Relationships with Other Classes**
The `ColumnDependency` class interacts with multiple components in the **TCDX model**:

- **ModelDependency** → Links the column to the specific tabular model.
- **TableDependency** → Represents the table that contains the referenced column.
- **Consumer** → Stores column dependencies used within Excel, Power BI, or other client applications.
- **Item** → Represents individual objects (pivot tables, visuals) that reference specific columns.
- **MeasureDependency** → Captures measure dependencies that rely on a specific column.

## **Conclusion**
The `ColumnDependency` class is a **critical component** of the **TCDX object model**, allowing for structured tracking of **column-level dependencies** in tabular models. By linking Consumers, Items, Tables, and Models, it provides **valuable insights** into how data is utilized.

This class is particularly useful for:
- **Auditing** → Understanding which columns are frequently used in reports and workbooks.
- **Performance Optimization** → Identifying unused or redundant columns that may impact model efficiency.
- **Governance & Data Lineage** → Ensuring compliance with best practices for data modeling and report design.

By integrating `ColumnDependency` into the TCDX model, organizations can **gain insights into tabular model usage** and **enhance data governance and performance** across Power BI, Excel, and other reporting tools.

## Note: 
for privacy reasons, strings are implemented as **TcdxName** objects, to allow a future implementation of objects anonymization.
