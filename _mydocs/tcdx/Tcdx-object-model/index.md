# **TCDX**

## **Overview**
The **TCDX.Metadata** library provides a structured representation of **tabular model metadata**, enabling **standardized tracking** of how **Power BI, Excel, and SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS)** interact with tabular models. It defines the **TCDX Object Model**, which organizes metadata related to **Consumers**, **QueryGroups**, and **Model Dependencies**.

By leveraging **TCDX.Metadata**, developers and BI professionals can analyze:
- **Which applications (Consumers) reference tabular models**.
- **How queries (QueryGroups) interact with tables, columns, and measures**.
- **Model dependencies, tracking key relationships within a dataset**.

This library is designed to **enable interoperability, improve governance, and enhance performance optimization** across **various BI tools**.

## **TCDX Object Model**
The **TCDX Object Model** is structured around three key components:

### **1. Consumers**
A **Consumer** represents an application that interacts with a **tabular model**, such as:
- **Excel workbooks** (pivot tables, Power Query).
- **Power BI reports** (DAX queries, visuals).
- **Other business intelligence tools** that access tabular data.

Each Consumer maintains:
- **Metadata about the client application** (e.g., Power BI, Excel).
- **Items** that reference tabular model components (pivot tables, visuals, etc.).
- **Dependencies on tables, columns, and measures**.

### **2. QueryGroups**
A **QueryGroup** captures **queries executed** against a tabular model, including:
- **Query sources** (Power BI Query Analytics, SQL Profiler, Extended Events).
- **Execution details** (query count, duration, performance insights).
- **Data dependencies** (referenced tables, columns, and measures).

QueryGroups help in **performance analysis, optimization, and data governance** by tracking **query execution patterns**.

### **3. Model Dependencies**
The **Model Dependencies** component provides insights into **how Consumers and QueryGroups relate to a tabular model**, tracking:
- **ModelDependency** â†’ The referenced tabular model.
- **TableDependency** â†’ Tables accessed within the model.
- **ColumnDependency** â†’ Columns used in queries and reports.
- **MeasureDependency** â†’ Measures applied in calculations.

These dependencies help organizations **understand model usage, optimize queries, and improve governance**.

## **Why Use TCDX.Metadata?**
TCDX.Metadata provides a **unified framework** for managing **tabular model interactions**, supporting:
- **Data lineage tracking**, ensuring visibility into **model usage**.
- **Query performance optimization**, identifying **slow or inefficient queries**.
- **Standardized metadata management**, enabling **cross-tool compatibility**.
- **Scalability**, ensuring that metadata tracking can evolve with **BI tool advancements**.

TCDX.Metadata is a **work in progress**, designed to be **extended and improved by the community**, ensuring **continued evolution and adoption** across the **Power BI and SSAS ecosystem**.

---

## **Conclusion**
The **TCDX.Metadata** library provides **a powerful, structured approach** to managing **tabular model metadata**, helping **BI professionals, data engineers, and developers** gain deeper insights into **model usage, query execution, and data dependencies**. 

By standardizing tabular model tracking, **TCDX.Metadata enables better governance, optimization, and interoperability** across **Power BI, Excel, and other BI tools**.
