You have several payment methods available. If you include a SQLBI+ subscription in your order, consider that SQLBI+ is a subscription with an automatic renewal according to the billing cycle you choose (every year or every 3 years for Enterprise bundles).

## Credit cards and debit cards
Credit and debit cards are always accepted and can be used for any license amount.

The credit card information is securely processed by our payment provider (Stripe), and we do not store any sensitive payment information on our servers.

The credit card will be used for the initial payment and for automatic renewals if you included a SQLBI+ subscription. When you pay by credit card or debit card, at every renewal cycle you receive an email with the receipt for your payment in form of a "paid invoice" that you can use for your accounting.

## Invoice
When you create an order, you can choose to pay by invoice by selecting the **Pay by Invoice / ACH / Wire Transfer** option. This payment type adds an additional fee because of the high fixed cost involved in these operations that cannot completely automated on the receiving part, plus additional fees charged by the bank for incoming transfer.

In-person courses registrations are confirmed once we receive the payment. Any service is activated once we receive the payment.

If you select this option for a SQLBI+ subscription, you will not be charged automatically at the end of the billing cycle. At every renewal, you will receive an invoice before the expiration date, which must be paid before the license expires.

## Wire Transfer / ACH Transfer
When you create an order, you can select **Pay by Invoice / ACH / Wire Transfer** to complete the purchase through a wire transfer or an ACH transfer. This payment type adds an additional fee because of the high fixed cost involved in these operations that cannot completely automated on the receiving part, plus additional fees charged by the bank for incoming transfer.

See the [Invoice](#invoice) section for more details about activation and renewal of SQLBI+ subscriptions.
