Using NONVISUAL has bugs when used in SUMMARIZECOLUMNS when the semantic model has **Coalesced** setting for [Value Filter Behavior](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/transform-model/value-filter-behavior). The result of the query changes depending on the expansion of the levels in the matrix visual that generates the DAX query.

Example of the inconsistent behavior:

Workarounds:

1. Use the **Independent** setting for Value Filter Behavior. This is the recommended solution.

2. Avoid using the filter arguments in **SUMMARIZECOLUMNS** and move filters in an outer CALCULATETABLE function (not possible for DAX queries generated by Power BI).
