## A. Introduction
1. These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) govern the use of transferable licenses provided by SQLBI Corp. (“SQLBI”) for its video courses and other premium content.
2. By purchasing or using a transferable license, you agree to abide by these Terms.

## B. License Grant
1. SQLBI grants you a transferable license to access a specific video course.
2. This license can be transferred between users within your organization as needed, but only one user may use a license at any given time.
3. For access to different video courses, a transferable license should be purchased for each different course. For example, a transferable license for the Mastering DAX video course will not enable access to the Mastering Tabular video course.
4. Transferable licenses may only be purchased by companies, not by private users.
5. Transferable licenses may only be transferred to students with the same email domain as the license manager.

## C. License Duration
1. Transferable licenses for **video courses** are typically valid for **36 months**. They do not automatically renew.
2. Transferable licenses for an **SQLBI+ subscription** are typically valid for **12 months** unless specified otherwise. The subscription automatically renews unless the user cancels it from inside their account.

## D. License Manager
1. The License Manager is the person who has access to a web interface provided by SQLBI to manage licenses.
2. The person assigned to the role of License Manager from the checkout page when purchasing the transferable license is the person who can:
   - Assign and revoke licenses.
   - Monitor users’ progress on video courses.
   - Enable users to self-enroll and manage their licenses.

## E. Transferability
1. Transferable licenses can be passed from user to user multiple times throughout the license's lifespan.
2. A license can only be assigned to one user at a time.
3. When a license is revoked from a user, it can be reassigned to another user.

## F. User Responsibilities
1. Users must comply with all applicable laws and regulations while using the licensed content.
2. Users must not share their access credentials with others.
3. Users must not copy, distribute, or otherwise exploit the licensed content beyond the scope allowed by these Terms.

## G. Restrictions
1. The license is limited to the number of concurrent users specified at the time of purchase.
2. Any unauthorized use of the license or content may result in termination of the license.

## H. Termination
