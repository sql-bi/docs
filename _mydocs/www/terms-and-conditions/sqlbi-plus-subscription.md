## A. General
1. By purchasing and accessing a subscription to SQLBI+ produced by SQLBI Corp. (“SQLBI”), you agree to the following terms and conditions.

## B. Definitions
1. SQLBI+ is a subscription service that gives subscribers access to several pieces of content (mostly but not limited to videos, white papers, sessions).
2. The list of the pieces of content that are included in the SQLBI+ subscription is available on the product page at [https://www.sqlbi.com/p/plus/](https://www.sqlbi.com/p/plus/).
3. The video courses inside SQLBI+ are different from the video courses you can find available for purchase at [www.sqlbi.com/training](https://www.sqlbi.com/training).

## C. Registration
1. The registration fee for a SQLBI+ subscription includes **12 months** of personal access to all the content and services bundled inside the subscription, including video courses, video sessions, white papers, and articles.
2. The content of the subscription is in English. For videos: hand-written subtitles are available in English. Automatic subtitle translations are available in a variety of languages, please refer to the product page for details.

## D. Assignment of Licenses
1. Transferable licenses are assigned by the license manager, only to students with the same email domain. External consultants are asked to manage their own training needs.
2. Non-transferable licenses can be assigned only once.

## E. Auto-Renew
1. SQLBI+ subscriptions renew automatically at the end of each billing cycle.
2. The presence of a “Recurring Total” at checkout indicates that the auto-renewal is active. If this indication is absent, or if explicitly stated otherwise, auto-renewal is not enabled.
3. You cannot disable automatic renewal yourself, but you can cancel your subscription through your account dashboard at any time.
4. Cancelling a subscription places it in a “pending cancellation” status: the subscription remains active until the next payment date, after which it becomes inactive and you will lose access to the subscription’s content and services.

## F. Access
1. Access to the contents is released to the student by our automated system as soon as it detects the funds on our bank account.
2. The video content of the subscription is hosted by SQLBI on Vimeo.com or YouTube.com – if you are in a country that blocks access to these platforms, you will need a VPN to access all the content.

## G. Refund Policy
1. Subscriptions can be refunded within 15 days from the purchase date and if less than 10% of each video course or session have been watched.
2. Cancellation of a subscription outside the above terms does not entitle the subscriber to a refund.

## H. Intellectual Property
1. SQLBI owns the intellectual property of all content provided in the video courses.
2. Unauthorized distribution, reproduction, or sharing of content is prohibited.

## I. User Conduct
1. Users must use the video courses for personal or internal business purposes only.
2. Any misuse, sharing of access to the license, or transfer of their personal account to another person may result in termination of access without refund.
