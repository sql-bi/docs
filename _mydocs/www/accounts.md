A SQLBI account is personal and must be tied to the email address of one physical person, the student's name. More details about accounts can be found in our [Terms of Conditions / Accounts section](../terms-and-conditions/video-courses#b-accounts).

# Merging accounts
When a user has several personal accounts on the SQLBI platform, accounts can be merged upon request by the user from inside one of the accounts:

1. [Login](https://www.sqlbi.com/account/) using the account you want to maintain.
2. Go to https://www.sqlbi.com/account/profile/
3. Scroll down to the *Merge accounts* section.
4. Press the **MERGE ACCOUNTS** button and follow the instructions.
5. Your request will be reviewed and validated within the next working day. You will receive a confirmation email once the process is completed.
