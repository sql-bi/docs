## A. Vendor enrollment
1. The request for us to fill out forms for the customer to be able to enroll SQLBI / Loader as a vendor is subject to an additional fee.
2. To avoid this fee: Standard documents are provided by SQLBI / Loader to the customer, and they contain the information that is requested in 99% of vendor enrollment systems or forms. The customer should use the information provided by our system to fill out their forms themselves.  

## B. Additional documents
1. Standard documents such as our W-9 and bank account information are provided automatically without any additional fee, attached to or included in both our quotes and our invoices. 
2. The request for additional documents from SQLBI / Loader is subject to an additional fee.
