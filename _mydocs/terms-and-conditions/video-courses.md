## A. Overview
1. These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) govern the use of regular licenses provided by SQLBI Corp. (“SQLBI”) for its video courses and other premium content.
1. By purchasing and accessing video courses produced by SQLBI, you agree to the following terms and conditions.

## B. Accounts
1. SQLBI accounts are personal. They must be tied to the email address of a physical person.
2. Accounts are not to be shared between people, and content cannot be transferred from one person’s account to another person’s account.
3. Generic email addresses, like a team name, are not accepted.
4. We conduct periodic and random checks to ensure non-transferable licenses are not being shared; determination by SQLBI that a non-transferable license or an account is being shared may lead to termination.
5. When a user has several personal accounts on the SQLBI platform, accounts can be merged upon request by the user from inside one of the accounts.
6. When a new purchase is made for someone who already has a SQLBI account, and they purchase a new license using the same email address as the one tied to their existing account, the system places the new license into that account immediately.
7. In the specific case of transferable licenses, these alone may be managed from a generic email address as we do not offer the possibility of having multiple license managers at this time.

## C. Registration and Access
1. **Access Duration**: Each video course purchase grants 36 months of desktop and mobile browser access to the videos, unless otherwise specified.
2. **Platform**: Paid courses are hosted on Vimeo. Access in certain countries may require a VPN.
3. **Language**: Courses are taught in English. English, hand-written subtitles are provided as well as a variety of other languages, which are automatic translations of the English version.

## D. Extensions
1. Courses may be extended for various periods of time, for a preferred price.
2. Users should look for the “EXTEND” button inside their account for the license they wish to extend.
3. The fee for the purchase of an extension covers the access to that video course for the number of months specified in the extension.

## E. Payment
1. **Fees**: The registration fee includes personal access to the selected video course(s).
2. **Promotions**: Discounts for events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday require payment clearance by specified dates.
3. **Access**: Access to the video course is released for the student as soon as the system detects the funds on the SQLBI bank account.

## F. Refund Policy
1. Refunds are available within 15 days of purchase, provided that less than 30% of the course has been watched.
2. Extensions are non-refundable and non-transferable.

## G. Assignment of Licenses
1. **Transferable Licenses**: The license manager assigns licenses to students with the same email domain. External consultants are asked to manage their own training needs separately.
2. **Non-transferable Licenses**: Can be assigned only once and there are no restrictions on email domain.

## H. Intellectual Property
1. SQLBI owns the intellectual property of all content provided in the video courses.
2. Unauthorized distribution, reproduction, or sharing of content is prohibited.

## I. User Conduct
1. Users must use the video courses for personal or internal business purposes only.
2. Any misuse, sharing of the access to the license, or transfer of their personal account to another person may result in termination of access without refund.

## J. Privacy
1. Personal data collected for course registration and access is protected under SQLBI’s privacy policy.
2. For details on data collection, protection, and sharing, please refer to our Privacy Policy at [www.sqlbi.com/privacy](https://www.sqlbi.com/privacy/).

## K. Modifications
1. SQLBI reserves the right to update these terms and conditions at any time.
2. Changes will be communicated through the official website.
