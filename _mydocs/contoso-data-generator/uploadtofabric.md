 - Azure Storage Explorer
 - AzCopy from the command line

## OneLake File Explorer

Currently in preview. It integrates with Windows File Explorer and allows you to manage files on Fabric with a OneDrive-like user-experience. Details here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/onelake/onelake-file-explorer

## AzCopy

First of all, login with AzCopy:

```
azcopy login
```

To test connectivity, try to list the files on the storage Tables partition:

```
azcopy list  https://onelake.blob.fabric.microsoft.com/<WORKSPACE-NAME>/<LAKEHOUSE-NAME>.Lakehouse/Tables  --trusted-microsoft-suffixes onelake.blob.fabric.microsoft.com
```

Upload all file:

```
azcopy copy "../out/*"  https://onelake.blob.fabric.microsoft.com/<WORKSPACE-NAME>/<LAKEHOUSE-NAME>.Lakehouse/Tables  --recursive --check-length --put-md5 --trusted-microsoft-suffixes onelake.blob.fabric.microsoft.com
```

It also possible to delete all existing files. **Be very careful!**
Import: for some unknown reasons, the command often fails. Retry many times till all files have been deleted successfully.

```
azcopy remove  https://onelake.blob.fabric.microsoft.com/<WORKSPACE-NAME>/<LAKEHOUSE-NAME>.Lakehouse/Tables/*  --recursive=true  --trusted-microsoft-suffixes onelake.blob.fabric.microsoft.com
```
