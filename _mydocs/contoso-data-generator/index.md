The Contoso Data Generator is a tool for generating sample data with random generated orders for the Contoso data model in order to provide demo data. Generated data is ready to be imported into PowerBI, Fabric OneLake and other platforms.

It consist of a c# program, to generate the data plus additional scripts for simplifying the activity, importing data to sql-server, etc. The tool is available on GitHub: [https://github.com/sql-bi/Contoso-Data-Generator-V2/](https://github.com/sql-bi/Contoso-Data-Generator-V2/)

If you are just interested in using **ready to use sets of data** generated by the tool, [download them here.](https://github.com/sql-bi/Contoso-Data-Generator-V2-Data)

Supported [output formats](formats.md):
 - Parquet
 - Delta Table (files)
 - CSV
 - CSV multi file
 - CSV multi file - gz compressed
 - Sql Server, via bulk-insert script of the generated CSV files

<br/> 

Delta Table output can be directly used in Fabric LakeHouse without any conversion:

## Usage

DataGenerator runs at command-line and requires four mandatory elements to run:
 - a configuration file (json)
 - a data file (excel)
 - an output folder
 - a cache folder
 - [optional parameters]

```
databasegenerator.exe  configfile  datafile  outputfolder  cachefolder   [param:AAAAA=nnnn] [param:BBBBB=mmmm]
```
Example:

```
databasegenerator.exe  c:\temp\config.json  c:\temp\data.xlsx  c:\temp\OUT\  c:\temp\CACHE\
```

<br/>

**Note**: the tool needs some files containing static data: fake customers, exchange rates, postal codes, etc. The files are cached after been downloaded over the Internet from a specific SQLBI repository. [More details](details.md).

<br/>

To simplify running the tool, [a set of scripts](scripts.md) is available.
